    <h1>A <a href="#">Template</a> for Killer Website Content</h1>

    <p>
      Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that the
      age-old adage,
      <u
        >“If you want it
        <a href="01_GettingStartedHTML.html"> done right, you gotta </a> do it
        yourself,”</u
      >
      can be a two-way street.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there are companies out there that have great web writers
      internally, but most don’t. And the <i>thought of a company turning</i> a
      great website content strategy (that we slaved over) into an ineffective
      <a href="http://iamrk.in" target="_blank"> site” </a>gives me heartburn.
      But sometimes you have to pick your battles.

    <h3>content template components</h3>

    <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank">
      <img
        src="images/clipart.png"
        width="110px"
        height="90px"
        title="clipart"
        alt="clipart"
      />
    </a>

    <p>
      <strong> Pre-writing questions:</strong> Before starting any given page,
      you really need to wrap your heads around the primary goal of the page and
      to whom this page is targeted. <br />
      What’s their pain? <br />
      What’s in it for them? <br />
      Where are they in their buying process? <br />
      And what keywords or phrases would they most likely use to search for your
      solution? <br />
      The best writers are those who can put themselves in the buyer’s shoes and
      write as if they are having a one-on-one conversation with that buyer.
