        As with most media, a great headline or page title can make or break a
        page. But specific to web content, it’s important to remember the SEO
        aspects. Integrating a major keyword/phrase into a headline and
        programming the page title with a relevant h1 tag can add some nice
        Google juice.

      <dt>Sub-headlines</dt>
      <dd>
        Visitors scan before they read, so creating enticing, benefits-focused
        sub-headlines can really boost the odds that your page will be read. I
        like to run a “scan test” on every page to see if I can get the gist of
        page by just scanning the page title, subheads, and call to action.
