            Over the years of developing websites for clients, I’ve learned that
            the age-old adage, “If you want it done right, you gotta do it
            yourself,” can be a two-way street.

              <p>
                Of course, there are companies out there that have great web
                writers internally, but most don’t. And the thought of a company
                turning a great website content strategy (that we slaved over)
                into an ineffective “brochure site” gives me heartburn. But
                sometimes you have to pick your battles.

                In cases where we give in and let the client take the content
                reins, we at least want to make sure they are equipped with a
                template that gives them a fighting chance to produce effective
                website content that drives action. Here is a template we like
